Examples of MATLAB code from a course in applied numerical methods

## Differentiation Formula + Test
The function graphs a function on an interval based on a derivative calculated using the differentiation formula. The test file tests the formula on three different functions.

## Gaussian Quadrature Estimate (GaussianQuadEst.m)
Estimates the integral of a function on an interval found with a 3 point Gaussian quadrature. The test file calculates the integrals of three functions and finds the error of the function compared to the MATLAB computed integral.

## Gaussian Quadrature and Trapezoid Estimate
Find the Gaussian quadrature and trapezoid estimates of the integral, and records a simple runtime for each. Compares each of the estimates and their runtimes to MATLAB computed integral.
